<h1>The Best Movies According to Amber</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Very touching story, fabulous imagination and metaphor of entering the adult world.</p>
<h3>I Am What I Am</h3>
<p>We always need movies about underdogs fighting against their destinies.</p>
<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>This is not a movie, however I cannot control myself not to mention it.</p>
